Kinect + Unity gamified software for foreign language learning for kids
====

This learning software demonstrate the potential of the Kinect device in foreign language learning for pupils from grades 1 to 4.
Kinect is a device for gaming that has built-in camera and infrared sensor. This sensor can provide full-body 3D motion capture, facial recognition and voice recognition capabilities. This device has a great potential in learning as it allows game based learning with games involving the movement of different parts of the body. This device allows to teachers to include in the learning process:

* Entertaining, interactive and engaging multimedia materials
* Learning resources that allow multi-sensory learning and
* Upgrading the standard games used in the learning process

A major part of the software development process was the development of a graphical user interface which is using only the Kinect Sensor as a input/output device. I used Unity as game development environment. I developed new functionality, which is named Hand Cursor. This is analogous to the ordinary computer mouse, except that it is controlled by movement and gestures of a human hand. It performs well-known actions - pushing and dragging an object. Another major part of the development was creation of my own gestures and integrating them into the software. The creation of gestures is done using programs provided by Microsoft.
